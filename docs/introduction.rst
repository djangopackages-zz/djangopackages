Introduction
=============

Django Packages helps the Django community to easily identify good apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Django blog, content management system, or api tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you!

A Django package is anything that is involved in the Django ecosphere that can be stored on a repository such as Github or Bitbucket. If it can be stored in Pypi thats even better!

The Site
--------

The site is live and functional at http://www.djangopackages.com.

Grids!
~~~~~~

Grids let you compare Django packages to each other. A grid comes with a number of default items compared, but you can add more features in order to get a more specific comparison.

We are trying out Django Packages without the traditional tagging system, because we think that grids give us a lot more specificity.

Categories of Django Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fixtures provide four categories: apps, frameworks, projects, and utilities.

Google Project Hosting and Sourceforge are not fully supported!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not yet. Django Packages was cooked up during Django Dash 2010. We wanted to keep the scope of our work reasonable. We'll try and include those sites in the future. We also want to include other package repo systems over time. As for what we support:

 * Django Packages does support Github and Bitbucket and Launchpad.
 * Sourceforge needs some tweaking but is otherwise it is done.
 * Google Project Hosting may not happen because of a lack of a formal API and not much desire to screen scrape their arcane browser interface.
