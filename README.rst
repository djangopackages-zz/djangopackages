Introduction
=============

Django Packages solves the problem in the Django community of being able to easily identify good apps, frameworks, and packages. Ever want to know which is the most popular or well supported Django blog, content management system, or api tool? Django Packages solves that problem for you!

A Django package is anything that is involved in the Django ecosphere that can be stored on a repository such as Github or Bitbucket. If it can be stored in PyPI thats even better!
